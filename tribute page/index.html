         Rajesh Khanna, in 1984.Later in an interview Irfan stated, "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been duplicated by anyone. 
         He was the biggest and the most real star Bollywood has produced. 
         I'd say stardom is that feeling of being possessed by your idol.
         you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose touch with reality.
